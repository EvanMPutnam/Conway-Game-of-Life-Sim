# Conway-Game-of-Life-Sim
An ascii graphics simulator for Conway's Game of Life.  This project was to get familiar with Conway's game of life and
Cellular Automata.  It was a fun little project and I am happy with the results.


# Library Used for Ascii was Ascii Panel by Trystan which can be found here https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel


## Instructions
First go into the editor.  Then press space to toggle alive or dead.  Dark blue
is alive and light blue is dead.  Then press escape to save that configuration.  
Arrow keys are to move in the editor.

## Things to Note
* Starts simulation on the following generation
* Speed set to 1 second a generation



### Things to do (If I ever get around to it)
* Create custom speed for simulations
* Load and save multiple templates
